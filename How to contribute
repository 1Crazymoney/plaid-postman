This documentation is primarily aimed at Plaid employees who would like to edit the collection. For instructions on using the collection, see the README.

#### Editing the Plaid Postman collection
The easiest way to edit the collection is to edit your own local copy of the collection using the Postman app. After downloading it, you can open the Plaid Postman collection and make edits. This is a pretty intuitive process, with a few things to be aware of:

Make sure to use the "tests" tab of the collection when appropriate to save values that will be used as input to other API calls. For example, when calling `/link/token/create`, we have the following under "tests":

```
let response = pm.response.json();
linkToken = response.link_token;
pm.environment.set("link_token", linkToken);
```

This code allows other API calls to reference ``{{link_token}}`` in the request body rather than requiring the user to copy and paste the Link token.

Make sure to rename examples to "OK" rather than using the default name.

#### Publishing the Plaid Postman collection

**Important: Before you publish the collection, make sure to clear the values of all environment variables except for the ones that were set before you downloaded the collection.**

When you are ready to publish the collection, do the following:

Click on the "..." next to the collection name and select "export" and then "Collection 2.1". Rename the resulting JSON file to match the name of the file used in the collection and add it to your commit.

Click on the "..." next to the collection name and click "share" -> "Via run in Postman" -> embed a static version -> generate code -> add an environment (select Sandbox) -> markdown version. 

Test the link generated to make sure it works correctly! If it doesn't, try restarting Postman and following the steps above. If it does work, copy and paste the markdown into the README, replacing the old button. Add the README to your commit.

Once your commit has been approved and you have merged your changes, copy the collection to the [Plaid Postman workspace](https://www.postman.com/plaid-api/workspace/plaid/collection/12160321-029fcda5-4c0c-478f-8fe4-0431f99e213e), overwriting the existing collection there, to update the version of the collection hosted on Postman. If you are not a member of the Plaid workspace, there should be a button in the Postman UI to request to join. If you can't find it, contact someone in DevRel.
